  ## Description
  
  As a web developer, having a professional README file communicates important information about a project, but it also shows that the developer is serious about quality work.  Generating a README file from scratch can be time-consuming and repetitive.  This is a node.js project allowing a developer to quickly generate a README.md file by answering several questions in the command line.

  ## Features
  
  This project features a command line interface, driven by the npm package Inquirer (v. 8.2.4).  It captures the user's answers in text and uses template literal syntax to insert those answers into a pre-defined template. The generated .md file includes several notable sections, with a table of contents linking to each section. This tool also generates a badge icon.
