## Please give a brief description of your project. (FS)
As a web developer, having a professional README file communicates important information about a project, but it also shows that the developer is serious about quality work.  Generating a README file from scratch can be time-consuming and repetitive.  This is a node.js project allowing a developer to quickly generate a README.md file by answering several questions in the command line.

## What features does your project have? (FS)
This project features a command line interface, driven by the npm package Inquirer (v. 8.2.4).  It captures the user's answers in text and uses template literal syntax to insert those answers into a pre-defined template. The generated .md file includes several notable sections, with a table of contents linking to each section. This tool also generates a badge icon.

## Please provide instructions for installing your project. (FS)
This project can be installed using Node Package Manager and installing the dependencies included in the package.json file.

## How will other developers use this project? (FS)
Once installed, other developers can simply initialize the app in the command line in the node environment by entering node index in the working directory and answering the prompts with information about their project.

## What testing would be applicable for this project? (FS)
I have not yet written tests for this project.  

## Are there any other developers that need to be credited for contributions on this project? (FS)
I have written this app on my own, following and modifying examples learned in coding classes.
